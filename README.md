Over 10 years strong in business administration and project management, I'm a PMO Analyst at VIRTUS, a tech, Researching, Development and Innovation Institute. I bring a unique blend of academic rigor (Master's in Construction Management, MBA in Project Management) with real-world experience (construction & HVAC project management). Always learning, I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Information Technology to stay ahead of the curve.

Think project guardian angel. I leverage tools and metrics to monitor and ensure the quality of project processes. Catching deviations and nonconformities is my superpower, allowing me to recommend corrective actions and keep things running smoothly.

Data-driven insights? I deliver. I empower senior management with the information they need for solid decision-making. Together, we implement best practices and continuously improve processes for optimal results.

My passion? Operational excellence. In previous roles, I thrived as a Project Manager, leading resource allocation across diverse construction and HVAC projects. I built strong relationships with engineers, architects, and vendors, while crafting and executing comprehensive project plans. Progress tracking, communication, and creating clear checkpoints and schedules were second nature.

Tech-savvy? You bet! I streamlined processes with tools like Quickbooks, Appfolio, and Housecall Pro, maximizing efficiency.

Beyond the professional realm? I'm a problem-solving whiz with excellent communication skills in both Portuguese and English. Building strong customer relationships comes naturally.

But wait, there's more! When I'm not optimizing projects, you'll find me on the tennis court, cherishing family time with my kid, exploring new destinations, or whipping up a delicious meal. Oh, and I'm constantly fascinated by how new technologies are transforming our lives!

Looking for someone with an "all in" attitude? I'm your person! Don't hesitate to reach out - I'm eager to collaborate and be part of something truly exciting
