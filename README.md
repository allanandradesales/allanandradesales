üíº About
With over a decade of experience in business administration and project management, I currently serve as a PMO Analyst at VIRTUS ‚Äì an institute dedicated to Research, Development, and Innovation in technology. I bridge academic excellence (Bachelor's in Business Administration  + MBA in Project Management) with hands-on experience leading and optimizing cross-functional projects.

As a ‚Äúproject quality guardian,‚Äù I specialize in tracking key metrics, identifying risks and deviations, and implementing corrective actions to ensure project alignment with strategic goals. My work empowers senior leadership through actionable insights and decision-making dashboards, always driven by data and performance indicators.

I thrive at the intersection of project governance and technology. Currently pursuing a Bachelor‚Äôs in Information Technology, I‚Äôm also building technical fluency in Node.js, React.js, Python, C, MongoDB, and Express.js. I actively apply agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban), streamline operations with tools like Trello, ClickUp, and QuickBooks, and support quality assurance across IT solutions.

Previously, I led multidisciplinary construction projects as a Project Manager‚Äîoverseeing planning, resource allocation, stakeholder coordination, and results delivery. From managing engineering teams to ensuring execution excellence, operational rigor is at the heart of my approach.

üîé What drives me? Continuous improvement, process optimization, and the real impact technology brings to modern project delivery.

Outside work, I enjoy tennis, traveling, family life, and exploring how emerging tech is reshaping our world.
