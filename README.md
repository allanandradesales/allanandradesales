I work at the intersection of project governance and tech entrepreneurship.

By day, I'm a Senior PMO Analyst at VIRTUS, one of Brazil's top R&D institutes, where I ensure governance and quality across complex software and hardware projects for Fortune 500 clients. Over 2+ years, I've built KPI frameworks, managed risks, and coached teams on Scrum/Kanban practices.

In parallel, I founded IMOBI ALL Holdings, a US company (Florida LLC) that connects American businesses with elite Brazilian engineering talent. We offer custom software development, AI/ML solutions, and R&D services, backed by 20+ years of institute track record and 2,000+ delivered projects, at 40-60% cost advantage.

What I bring: the discipline of enterprise PMO combined with the agility of a founder. I understand both sides, what clients need and how to deliver it.

Currently recruiting commission-based sales partners for IMOBI (15% on $50K-$500K deals).
